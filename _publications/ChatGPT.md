Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in
software engineering. Developers can use LLMs to address software
development-related tasks such as documentation, code refactoring,
debugging, and testing. ChatGPT, released by OpenAI, has become
the most prominent LLM. In particular, ChatGPT is a cutting-edge
tool for providing recommendations and solutions for developers
in their pull requests (PRs). However, little is known about the
characteristics of PRs that incorporate ChatGPT compared to those
without it and what developers usually use it for. To this end, we
quantitatively analyzed 243 PRs that listed at least one ChatGPT
prompt against a representative sample of 384 PRs without any
ChatGPT prompts. Our findings show that developers use ChatGPT
in larger, time-consuming pull requests that are five times slower
to be closed than PRs that do not use ChatGPT. Furthermore, we
perform a qualitative analysis to build a taxonomy of the topics
developers primarily address in their prompts. Our analysis results
in a taxonomy comprising 8 topics and 32 sub-topics. Our findings
highlight that ChatGPT is often used in review-intensive pull requests. Moreover, our taxonomy enriches our understanding of the
developerâ€™s current applications of ChatGPT.
