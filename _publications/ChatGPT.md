ChatGPT is a cutting-edge tool for providing recommendations and solutions for developers in their pull requests (PRs). However, little is known about the characteristics of PRs that incorporate ChatGPT compared to those without it and what developers usually use it for. To this end, we quantitatively analyzed 243 PRs that listed at least one ChatGPT prompt against a representative sample of 384 PRs without any ChatGPT prompts. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative analysis to build a taxonomy of the topics developers primarily address in their prompts.
