Web apps are evolving rapidly to acquire new features, correct errors or adapt to new environment changes especially with the volatile context of the web development. These ongoing amends often affect software quality due to poor coding and bad design practices, known as code smells or anti-patterns. Therefore, it is critical for web apps to monitor the existence and spread of such anti-patterns.
