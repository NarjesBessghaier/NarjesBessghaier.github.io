Modern software systems are designed to be deployed in different configured environments (e.g., permissions, virtual resources, network connections), and adapted at run-time to different situations (e.g., memory limits, enabling/disabling features, database credentials). Such a configuration during the deployment and run-time of a software system is implemented via a set of configuration files, which together constitute what we refer to as a “configuration system”. Recent research efforts investigated the evolution and maintenance of configuration files. However, they merely focused on a limited part of the configuration system (e.g., specific infrastructure configuration files or Dockerfiles), and their results do not generalize to the whole configuration system.
