Background. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an
emerging practice to manage cloud infrastructure resources for
software systems. Modern software development has evolved to
embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and
managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform
and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers
still encounter various challenges with IaC tools.
Aims. We aim in this paper to understand the different
challenges that developers encounter with IaC and analyze the
trend of seeking assistance on Q&A platforms in the context
of IaC. To this end, we conduct a large-scale empirical study
investigating developers’ discussions in Stack Overflow.
Method. We first collect IaC-relevant tags on Stack Overflow,
constituting a dataset that comprises 52,692 questions and 64,078
answers. Then, we group questions into specific topics using the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method, which we optimize
using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter’s fine-tuning.
Finally, to gain better insights, we analyze the identified topics
based on different criteria such as popularity and difficulty.
Results. Our findings reveal an average yearly increase of
150% in terms of IaC-related questions and 135% in terms of
users between 2011 and 2022. Furthermore, we observe that IaC
questions revolve around seven main topics: server configuration,
policy configuration, networking, deployment pipelines, variable
management, templating, and file management. Notably, we found
that server configuration and file management are the most popular
topics, i.e., the most discussed among IaC developers, while the
deployment pipelines and templating topics are the most difficult.
Conclusions. Our results shed light on IaC challenges that
are often encountered by developers on popular Q&A platforms.
These findings reveal important implications for practitioners
seeking better support for IaC tools in real-world settings and
for researchers to better understand the IaC community needs
and further investigate IaC in different aspects.
