Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an emerging practice to manage cloud infrastructure resources for software systems. Modern software development has evolved to embrace IaC as a best practice for consistently provisioning and managing infrastructure using various tools such as Terraform and Ansible. However, recent studies highlighted that developers still encounter various challenges with IaC tools.
