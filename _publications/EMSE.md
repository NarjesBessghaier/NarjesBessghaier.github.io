Code review (CR) is a common practice in which developers (i.e., reviewers) review code changes submitted by their peers to fix errors and ensure that the code adheres to standards. Previous studies have shown that MCR can improve the overall quality of the code, and that MCR practices may vary depending on the code under review. Yet, little is known about how MCR practices are used in the context of Infrastructure-as-Code.
