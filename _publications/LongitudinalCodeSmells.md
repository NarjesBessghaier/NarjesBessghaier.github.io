Modern web applications have become one of the largest parts of the current software market over years, bringing cross-platform compatibility and data integration advantages that encouraged businesses to shift toward their adoption. Like any software application, code smells can be manifested as violations of implementation and design standards which could impact the maintainability, comprehensibility and performance of web applications. While there have been extensive studies on traditional code smells recently, little knowledge is available on code smells in web-based applications (web apps).
