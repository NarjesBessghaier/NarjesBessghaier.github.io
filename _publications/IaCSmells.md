Similarly to other code files, Infrastructure-as-Code files can suffer from violations of established implementation and design standards, i.e., IaC smells. Although prior research has studied various aspects of traditional smells in non-IaC artifacts, there is little knowledge of how IaC smells are prevalent, co-occurring, and impacting the change and defect proneness of IaC code.
