I am a Software Engineering Ph.D. graduate (2025) from École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS), Canada, where I worked with Prof. [Ali Ouni](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/aouni/) in the [Software Technology and Intelligence Research Lab (STIL)](https://stilab-ets.github.io). My research focuses on AI-driven recommendation systems for developer productivity, particularly in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration. With 6+ years of research experience, I’ve published 11 papers in top venues (SANER, MSR, TOSEM, EMSE, ESEM) and served on the MSR’24 program committee.
