I am a Software Engineering PhD student at École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS), University of Quebec, Canada. Currently working on the quality of configuration systems including Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). I work on my Ph.D with Prof. [Ali Ouni](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/aouni/) in the [Software Technology and Intelligence Research Lab (STIL)](https://stilab-ets.github.io). My work focuses on building recommendation systems to support developers in their configuration development tasks. Previously, I also researched topics related to the restructuring of mobile applications user interfaces, including the aesthetics and usability quality criteria. With more than 7 years of experience in research, my work resulted in 12 papers published in top-tier journals and conferences, including SANER, MSR, TOSEM, ESEM, and SQJ (citations: 98, h-index: 7).
