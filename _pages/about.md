I hold a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), Canada (2025), where I conducted my doctoral research under the supervision of Prof. [Ali Ouni](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/aouni/) in the [Software Technology and Intelligence Research Lab (STIL)](https://stilab-ets.github.io). My research centers on AI-driven recommendation systems for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration, with an emphasis on improving software quality and developer productivity. I hold a Master’s degree in Software Systems Engineering from ISIMS, Tunisia (2017), where I focused on evaluating the quality of user interfaces in mobile applications. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Management, during which I developed my first 3D educational video game exploring the history of French colonization. With over six years of research experience, I have authored 11 peer-reviewed publications in top-tier software engineering venues, including SANER, MSR, TOSEM, EMSE, and ESEM. I also served on the program committee for MSR 2024.
