Narjes Bessghaier holds a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), Canada (2025). Her research focuses on AI-driven recommendation systems for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), with an emphasis on improving software quality, security, and developer productivity in DevOps environments. She earned a Master’s degree in Enterprise Systems Engineering from ISIMS, Tunisia (2017), where her work examined the quality of user interfaces in mobile applications. Her academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Management in ISGG, Tunisia (2015), during which she developed her first 3D educational video game exploring the history of French colonization of Tunisia.
With over six years of research experience, Narjes has authored 11 peer-reviewed publications in leading software engineering venues, including SANER, MSR, TOSEM, EMSE, and ESEM. She has contributed to the research community through service on the program committee for MSR 2024, as a local chair for SEMLA 2024, and by volunteering at various academic events. Throughout her academic career, she has received multiple awards and is nominated for the PhD Excellence Award 2025. Her long-term vision is to advance trustworthy and secure automation practices at the intersection of software engineering and AI for DevOps.
